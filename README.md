## Overview

ClimateScoop merges rigorous data analysis with interactive visualization to present climate data in an engaging and informative manner.

## Architecture and Data Flow

ClimateScoop employs a structured approach to data handling, from fetching and validation to caching and visualization, optimized for performance and user experience. The architecture supports seamless data processing and integration, presenting information through interactive, dynamic charts and graphs.

**Data Processing and Flow:**

```
+-----------+     +------------+     +--------------+     +---------------+
|           |     |            |     |              |     |               |
| API Fetch +---> + Validation +---> +   Pre/Post   +---> +     Data      |
|           |     | (with Zod) |     |  Processing  |     | Visualization |
