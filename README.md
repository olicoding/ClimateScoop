# dciConn

**dciConn** – short for "Developers Community Interface for Connection" – is a platform designed to foster connections and collaboration within the developer community, with a particular focus on open-source projects. It serves as a platform for developers to discover open-source projects open for contributions and enables those projects to search for developers offering technical expertise, facilitating connections from both sides for potential collaborations.

## Vision

The vision is to establish dciConn as the go-to resource for developers to effortlessly find open-source projects that align with their expertise and passion. The platform bridges the gap between a developer's drive for growth, community engagement, or collaborative creativity and the vast world of open-source opportunities. And vice versa!

## Current State

dciConn is in the early stages of design and ideation. We are in the process of transforming a study project into this new platform, designing wireframes, defining the scope, and establishing foundational tools and workflows.
