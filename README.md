# Coming Soon!

## Projects Refactor and Merger

Revitalizing two past bootcamp projects, Iâ€™m blending a modern tech stack with Next.js, Auth0, and MongoDB with a project dedicated to the topic Climate Change. The goal is to craft a modern platform to showcase my technical skills and potentially serve a real-world application. With a 'Coming Soon' page already live, the platform is set for ongoing updates and evolution, embodying a synergy of practice and purpose.
