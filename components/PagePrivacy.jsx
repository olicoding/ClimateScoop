      <p>
        Welcome to ClimateScoop, a web application dedicated to providing

      <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>
        ClimateScoop utilizes Vercel Analytics to anonymously track visitor
        counts and countries of origin. This helps us understand user engagement
        and continuously improve our platform. We do not collect any personal
        information from our users.

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        ClimateScoop uses minimal local storage for essential functionality and
        improved performance. You can clear your browser&apos;s cache and local
        storage at any time through your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We use basic Vercel Analytics, and store a confirmation token in your
        local storage to remember your acknowledgment of the privacy banner. We
        don&apos;t use cookies or tracking mechanisms to collect personal data.
      </p>
